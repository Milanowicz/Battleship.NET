Battleship
==========
It's the classic Battleship Game for Windows with .NET 4.0 Framework. 

You can play against each other on the local machine, I haven't wrote network sockets to play on network.

You can play against the computer, that is the standard version. If you have no desire to play, you can also just let the computer play against each other.


Development
==========
This is a lillte school project written in VB.NET.

I wrote this project in Visual Studio 2010, but it works fine in VS 2012 too. I've tested it, before I've released it here.
